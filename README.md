# Predictive Analysis of Health Service Demand

## Overview
This repository contains a predictive analysis project focused on forecasting future demands for health services. Utilizing time-series models, the project analyzes past visit trends to project future service demands, considering factors such as employee assignments, client requirements, and group classifications. The analysis is segmented by crucial service types, specifically 'Home Care' and 'Mental Health', and further delineated by geographical zones.

## Features
- Time-series forecasting models to predict service demand.
- Categorization of predictions by service type and geographical zone.
- Comprehensive data preparation scripts to transform and clean datasets.
- Detailed trend analysis and business strategy recommendations.

## Installation
To run the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
`https://github.com/anush97/city_hosp_forecasting.git
cd city_hosp_forecasting
pip install -r requirements.txt`

also install power BI desktop latest version

## Usage
Navigate to the notebook directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to view the analysis:

`cd notebooks
jupyter notebook`


## Data
The project uses historical data on health service visits, which includes details like client cities, service types, employee assignments, and visit dates. Data sources are cleansed and pre-processed for the predictive modeling.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Extracted and cleaned data from Power BI, focusing on time-series analysis.
2. **Predictive Model Development**: Employed time-series forecasting models, incorporating seasonality and observed trends.
3. **Categorized Predictions**: Forecasted future visits by service type and zone, assessing model performance.
4. **Business Problem Solving**: Analyzed trends to predict changes in service demand and identified areas for resource allocation or expansion.

## Results
The project successfully forecasts service demand, providing categorized predictions that assist in strategic planning and resource management. Key insights and recommendations are documented in the project's report section.
